# Voice activity detection using subband noncircularity
Code for paper [1] presented at ICASSP 2015. Please cite this paper if you find this code useful! There are two main scripts ready to be run out of the box:

main_demo.m Reproduces figures 3 and 4 from [1]

main_test_circ_vad.m Computes the single-channel summed degree of impropriety (SDOI) metric from [1] on the included example audio, which comes from the QUT-NOISE corpus [2].
